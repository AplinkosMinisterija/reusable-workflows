# This workflow helps ensure that the code of the action we're going to deploy:
# 1. Is well-formated
# 2. Is linted
# 3. Successfully builds
# 4. Passes unit-tests
# Additionally node packages used by the action can be audited.
# Based on https://github.com/actions/reusable-workflows/blob/main/.github/workflows/basic-validation.yml
